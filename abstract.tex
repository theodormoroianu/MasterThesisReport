This thesis aims to create a testbed for easily replicating and analyzing Database Management System (DBMS) transactional or isolation bugs, use this testbed to replicate and analyze a set of known bugs, and develop a novel bug-finding tool.

First, we create a testbed leveraging containerization technology to easily spin-up and run a variety of custom versions of DBMSs. The testbed provides an easy way of running concurrent transaction workloads, and generates logs of the testcases being executed. It also provides an easy way of starting multiple MySQL shells connected to arbitrary versions of the \textit{MySQL}, \textit{MariaDB} and \textit{TiDB} DBMSs.

We then use the testbed to replicate and analyze a set of known bugs in \textit{MySQL}, \textit{MariaDB} and \textit{TiDB}. We find that a majority of the replicated bugs happen on all isolation level supported by the DBMS, and we then analyze in depth the bugs manifesting under only a subset of the isolation levels, which can happen either because the bug does not affect some isolation levels, or the proof-of-concept (PoC) testcases included in the bug report do not trigger the bug.

Finally, we built on top of the theory behind the \textit{TxCheck} fuzzer, and find a novel way to improve the bug-finding technique, which leverages transaction dependencies graphs computed using SQL-level instrumentation. We also implement this technique on top of the \textit{TxCheck} fuzzer.
